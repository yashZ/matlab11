Tracking Based POMDP is not affected by Horizon very largely, 
The only change that comes in policy for tracking based pomdp is that it tries
to find the person in a more structured way

POMDPIR is affected by horizon, with long term planning proving to be better
Reason first is structure and second is it looks for the person in other places when planning for long term horizon
